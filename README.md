# 🤖 AI-Powered Customer Support Simulation Using CrewAI
## 📌 Description
This project showcases a conceptual AI-powered customer support system built using CrewAI, simulating a workflow where multiple AI agents collaborate to respond to customer inquiries. It is inspired by how public sector organizations might implement intelligent automation. The context references the UK Government’s Department for Work and Pensions for illustrative and educational purposes only, this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any governmental body.

## 🎯 Objective
To demonstrate how CrewAI agents can simulate a structured customer service pipeline including resolution and quality assurance, by utilizing a multi-agent architecture powered by large language models.

## 🚀 Features
- LLM-Driven Agents: Agents operate based on custom goals and backstories using OpenAI’s GPT-4o.

- Task Workflow: Each inquiry undergoes a resolution and a quality review phase to ensure completeness and tone.

- Web Search Tool: Integrated with CrewAI Tools to enhance responses with real-time web references.

- Streamlit Interface: A simple frontend for users to enter inquiries and view the AI-generated response.

- Modular Codebase: Agents, tasks, tools, and execution logic are cleanly separated for easy extensibility.

## ✅ Conclusion
This prototype provides a compelling example of how large language models can simulate structured, human-like workflows using agent collaboration. While built for demonstration, the project sets the foundation for more advanced service automation use cases.

## 🔭 Future Work

- Integrate persistent memory and user profiles for context-rich interactions

- Add multilingual support for broader accessibility

- Expand agent roles (e.g., escalation manager, policy expert)
